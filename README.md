# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## Project overview:
On this project, i developed a bank branch management system to manage information about the bank branches. The system should ensure that only one instance of the branch information  exists throughout the application, following the Singleton design design patter.

The Bank Branch Management System aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution for managing branch information using the Singleton design pattern. By ensuring that only one instance of the BankBranch class exists, the system maintains data consistency and improves application performance.
## Elements included:
-JavaScript objects
-polymorphism
-classes and prototypes
-inheritance
-encapsulation
## Areas of mastery:
-Getting a better understanding in creating and manipulating JavaScript objects.
-Getting to understand polymorphism and its apllication in object-oriented programming even though its difficult, but its good that i got to get some concepts and rules in.
-The ability to utilize prototypes effectively for object creation and behaviour delegation.
## Challenges:
-Understanding the nuances of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
-Implementing complex polymorphic behaviour in large scale projects.
-Dealing with performance issues related to prototype chains and method lookups.
# Areas of improvement:
-Enhancing understanding of design patterns and their application in JavaScript projects.
-Exploring alternative approaches to object-oriented programming, such as functional programming paradigms.
# Overall learning experience:
This project enhanced my experience and knowledge in JavaScript object-oriented fetaures, particularly in handling string manipulation and validation tasks. It improved my understanding of regular expressions and debugging techniques.

A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_8_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL08
2. Open the cloned project in your code editor.
3. Code your solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your local Git repository to your GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.

## What You Need to Include:

1. Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
2. Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

## How We'll Assess Your Work:

1. We will review your GitHub repository to ensure that it contains the updated code files.
2. We will assess the modifications made to the code to verify that they effectively meet the challenge requirements.
3. We will consider the commit history and meaningful commit messages to evaluate your coding process.

This challenge will test your ability to create a function with the Singleton Pattern. Woohoo! Your first design pattern!
